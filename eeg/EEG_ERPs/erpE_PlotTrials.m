% plot ERPs of on time, late, and missing stim and responses (when present)

% plot power for the above


% plot normalized erp and power for on time and late responses so squished



% correlate delta, theta, alpha, beta, of every channel with RT

% repeat above, split by hemifield


% for every power band, plot hits, lates and misses topos, and their
% differences



% repeat above, but split by attention hemifield

% if there are notable clusters, then do corr plot?



% eventually (after looking at hit rates in space) compare periferal lapses
% with central lapses
